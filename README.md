# USB Rubber Ducky Repository
## Ashish D'Souza
*October 8th, 2018*

This is a repository containing various payloads for the USB Rubber Ducky by Hak5. The best payload developed so far is the Powershell Reverse Shell, undetectable by antivirus and unblockable by firewalls, taking a mere 3 seconds to execute on the victim's computer. All the code is in this repository, but I will not be showing how to use it, because it is dangerous enough already.

## Built With
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
* [Windows Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-scripting)
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [USB Rubber Ducky](https://hakshop.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) (the [Arduino Micro](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-micro) serves as a suitable replacement)
